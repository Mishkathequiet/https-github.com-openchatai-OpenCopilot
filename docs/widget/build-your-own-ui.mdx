1. Ok Let's start by creating simple Copilot on [opencopilotCloud](https://cloud.opencopilot.so)

2. Install `@openchatai/copilot-widget` in a pre-existing React app.

```bash
npm install @openchatai/copilot-widget
```

3. Let's import `Root` & `CopilotWidget`

```tsx
import { Root, CopilotWidget } from "@openchatai/copilot-widget";
```

As we have said before `Root` holds the widget state and message handling logic, and `CopilotWidget` is the chat UI component.

4. `Root` Wrapper requires some options to be passed to it.

```tsx
import type { Options } from "@openchatai/copilot-widget";
// these are the required options for now.
const options: Options = {
  token: "YOUR_TOKEN", // head to https://cloud.opencopilot.so to get your token.
  apiUrl: "https://api.opencopilot.so/backend",
  socketUrl: "https://api.opencopilot.so",
  initialMessage: "Hello, I need help!",
  triggerSelector: "",
  defaultOpen: true,
};
```

5. Now we have the Widget on the screen(it is fluid and it will take the width&height of the parent container).
   So far we have

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Root, CopilotWidget } from "@openchatai/copilot-widget";
import type { Options } from "@openchatai/copilot-widget";

const options: Options = {
  token: "YOUR_TOKEN", // head to https://cloud.opencopilot.so to get your token.
  apiUrl: "https://api.opencopilot.so/backend",
  socketUrl: "https://api.opencopilot.so",
  initialMessage: "Hello, I need help!",
  triggerSelector: "",
  defaultOpen: true,
};

function OpencopilotCustomWidget() {
  return (
    <Root options={options}>
      <CopilotWidget />
    </Root>
  );
}

export default OpencopilotCustomWidget;
```

<Note>
  The whole idea about opencopilt is to allow users to execute businuss actions
  and return the result to the user in a chat like interface.
</Note>

5. So we will ge to the [dashboard](https://cloud.opencopilot.so/) to setup some actions and then we will be able to execute them from the chat interface.
   Click on the Copilot you just created and then click on the `Actions` tab.

use any API you want to use, for example we will use dummy data returned by jsonplaceholder. 

<Note>
  In this demo we are testing the UI handling, so we will not go into the
  details of creating actions.
