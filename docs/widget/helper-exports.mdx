- By default the UI response is rendered without bot icons or any meta murcup 
by using `BotMessageWrapper` that wraps the ui response will get the job done. 

``` tsx
import { BotMessageWrapper } from "@openchatai/copilot-widget";
```
- Use the `ComponentProps<"YOUR_DATA_TYPE_RETURNED_FROM_THE_API">` generic type to define props for the custom component that will be used to render the UI response. This extends the `BotMessageType` to include the data type returned from the API.

``` tsx

type WeatherInfo = {
  data: {
    temperature: string;
    humidity: string;
  };
};

type Props = ComponentProps<WeatherInfo>;

const WeatherInfo: React.FC<Props> = ({ data }) => {
  return (
      <div>
        <h3>Weather Info</h3>
        <p>Temperature: {data.temperature}</p>
        <p>Humidity: {data.humidity}</p>
      </div>
  );
};
```

- Other helper Hooks 
    - `useLang` to get the current language of the widget (the same as language option defined during the initilization of the widget).
    - `useWidgetState` to get the current state of the widget (open or close), you can even close the widget.
    - `useSendMessage` to trigger a message from the widget. 
```tsx
import {useSendMessage} from "@openchatai/copilot-widget";
```
``` tsx
const WeatherInfo: React.FC<Props> = ({ data }) => {
const {send} = useSendMessage();
  return (
      <div>
        <h3>Weather Info</h3>
        <p>Temperature: {data.temperature}</p>
        <p>Humidity: {data.humidity}</p>
      </div>
  );
};
```
- `Root` 
if you are going to build your own UI for the widget you will need to wrap your component with `Root` to get the widget context. 

it accepts the following props 
    - `options` of type `ConfigDataContextType`.
    - `children` to render the widget UI.

- `CopilotWidget` 
it is the widget UI where the `Root` component should be wrapped with. 
it accepts the following props 
    - `triggerSelector` (optional) to define the trigger element to open/close the widget.
      if not provided an icon will appear on the left side of the screen to open/close the widget.
