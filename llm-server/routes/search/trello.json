Table makes it easy for teams to collaborate, align, and deliver work with the ability to see cards or tasks in a compact, manageable table format alongside crucial information like lists, labels, members, and due dates.Feature focus:Adding cards: From the Table view, easily add new tasks by clicking the + between line items.Filtering and sorting cards: Filter and sort cards by lists, labels, members, and due dates to highlight relevant information from the board.Editing cards: Edit basic details of a card from within the context of the table view. All modifications made will be reflected on the board.The Table view is great for:Working from a list: Jump right in and start adding tasks to a handy list of items to accomplish and add information to every task as you go along.Evaluating an in-progress project: Table view facilitates a single glance of what work is in the pipeline by pulling together cards from all lists on a board and hence giving the freedom to make edits to current work or add new items from one single list.Keeping track of personal and team member workloads: Cards on a board that you have been assigned to can be filtered to just show yours. Managers can make sure that workload is equilibrated between team members to prevent burnout.Collecting discussion topics ahead of time and create action items during team meetings: Save the team time and keep meetings structured by pulling together a meeting agenda in Table before the meeting begins.Calendar viewPlan faster and better with the Calendar view. From tracking team progress to staying on top of your work, give a time dimension to your projects. Calendar helps you anticipate any roadblocks, events or deadlines, to take your team smoothly to the finish line.Feature focus:Calendar:Cards can be viewed in the Calendar in a monthly view, to get the big picture, or weekly view, to focus on the work ahead of you. At a glance see all the relevant dates of your project—add start and due dates to cards and your cards will appear in Calendar view.Today and time arrows:Easily navigate through time with header controls for finding the right day. You can always click “today” just in case you get lost.Add start/due dates:Get the granularity you need to get your work done. With full-day events and multi-date events, you and your team can more easily grasp the big picture.Drag and drop cards:The Trello way to organize and move things around is now in Calendar, too. Drag your cards to new dates with the calendar and it will auto-magically update the dates on your cards, conveniently syncing within Calendar view as well.Stretch cards:Easily pick a side of a card and stretch it to set up date ranges, which can span multiple days or weeks.Advanced checklists:Items with due dates are supported , where you can view, drag, and mark as an advanced checklist item is completed.Create new cards:If you think that a card is missing for your project to have all the pieces it needs, quickly add cards from the Calendar view by double clicking on a date.The Calendar view is great for:Tracking team progress:from keeping track of sales meetings with leads and close dates to managing interviews in a hiring pipeline, quickly discover the status of every task.Planning work that lies ahead:Whether you are building a strong marketing editorial calendar or planning your next event or conference, you can easily map out any time-based event.On the go due date tracking:Check out the Calendar view on the go from the Trello app. Using this view on mobile, you can visualize critical due dates and tasks from anywhere.Staying on top of tasks:For you or your team,  easily be reminded of any work that needs to be done.Timeline viewTimeline is a beautiful, tactile view of how the team’s work fits together. Build a powerful yet easy-to-use Timeline for any project you are working on. You'll catch any roadblocks before they happen, view upcoming deadlines, and stay aware of all the work your team is working on. You'll become the maestro of your project and your team will thank you for how smoothly everything is being managed.Feature focus:Lanes:Lanes are the placeholders for cards. A lane can be shared by various cards as long as they don’t share the same period of time—in which case, a new lane is created. They let you get perspective on how tasks fit together on your timeline.Today and time arrows:Same as for the calendar, \"today\" and time arrows are your ally when it comes to navigating your timeline and not getting lost too far ahead.Add start/due dates:From the card back, add a start date and due date. Once your card has a date and is in a lane, you are ready to stretch the date range. You'll be able to stretch them naturally over the timeline to set up a new date range.Unscheduled cards drawer:All cards with no dates can be easily accessed here. Just open it up, choose the card, and add a date. Voila, your card will pop on your timeline and fit immediately at the right place to make your plan move forward.Group by:Grouping lets you have a different perspective of your workload and organize your timeline by list, member, or label. Want to see a team member's workload? Group by member and immediately drag and drop cards between lanes if some tasks need to be rearranged to have a balanced workload within your team.Zoom in:Change the granularity of time by zooming in. You can now zoom by day/week/month/quarter/year so you can travel from your team’s weekly goals to your quarterly planning or your yearly roadmap.Timeline view is great for:Planning every product sprint from start to ship:Create anew labelfor each sprint to organize cards in lanes by sprint and see your project come together from start to finish.Getting a birds-eye-view on company goals and OKRs:Zoom out to quarterly and yearly views in Timeline and see everything in the pipeline that ladders up to the company goals.Organizing and executing events seamlessly:Attach slide decks, assets, and speaker information to cards to keep everything organized in one place and always on hand during the event with the Timeline view on your mobile device.Managing team workload and preventing overload:Discover which team members have time to take on more tasks or when work needs to be divided up and conquered together.Checking and adjusting your timeline on the go:The Timeline view works really well in your Trello app so you can keep track of and update dates on from anywhere.Dashboard viewAdd data points to your project to make decisions faster and better. With the Dashboard view, you can create the charts that your team needs to identify any roadblock or highlight any win that will turn your project into a successful one. Visualize key metrics like due dates, assigned cards, and cards per list to keep stakeholders aligned and confidence running high. With historical data and different chart types, create the dashboard that will put your team on the pole position.Feature focus:Default charts:To help you evaluate your workload, by default, Trello starts you off with four charts based on card counts per filter - Cards per list, cards per member, cards per label, and cards per due date status. A dashboard was built for you to save you time and help you focus on the work you need to get done.Editing:Editing allows you to choose between visualizing your data in a bar graph or pie chart. Pick the one that will make your reporting digestible.Deleting:Tailor the information that appears on the Dashboard by adding or removing charts, allowing you to create a customized dashboard.Historical data:See how work has progressed over time with the ability to view cards per list in the past 30 days.Dashboard is great for:Managing project roadblocks:Easily access cards that stay in a list for too long. This feature is perfect for analyzing the health of your sales pipeline, recruiting pipeline, or any workflow that needs to constantly move forward.Monitoring project progress:Analyze information per list, label, or due date to get a data-driven understanding of your project.Knowing what everyone is working on:Understand your team member workload using historical data.Map viewFor many, projects involve more than just tasks and due dates—they involve places. To make sure your team has all the elements they need to make wise decisions, you can add locations to cards and view all those locations in one single place: the Map view.Feature focus:Locations:Add locations to a card to position it on the Map view.Searching:Map view is connected to Google Maps, so you can search any location from its address or even by typing the name of the place you’re looking for.Locations pins:To keep the project context at hand, you'll be able to see all the card front information by clicking on the locations pins on the map.Add card:From the Map view, you'll see all cards with a location enabled, and if you wish to create a card you can do it directly from the Map view by clicking \"Add Card on the right hand top corner of the map.Map view is great for:Planning in-person meetings:Simplify IRL meetings by navigating between different locations directly from the Map view.Mapping out location resources:Whether you own different stores or manage assets in different places, adding location details can help you have a better understanding of where things stand.Managing pipelines with physical items:Manage your rental listing and provide an extra layer of context by adding a location to the card that represents them.Having all relevant information at hand:Map view is also available on mobile through the Trello app. Location-based projects or services become even more useful when you’re on the go and you can save time by having all relevant information about your client easily accessible.Workspace viewsGain perspective across your team with the Workspace Table or Workspace Calendar views, which act like supercharged versions of our regular Table and Calendar views. Workspace Table and Workspace Calendar views both allow you to view cards fromacross multiple Trello boards in one place.

Learn how to set permissions and administer teams successfully.Every team needs a digital space where they can easily connect ideas and projects across company silos. Allowing users to be added to a project based on their permission and accessing and creating content freely is key for keeping a healthy business environment.By having all the control at your fingertips, your team can scale while keeping intellectual property safe within Trello.SECTION OVERVIEWIn this section you will learn:Workspace administrationMembers and guests permissionsUser management with Trello PremiumWorkspace administrationDo you need to enforce security and privacy across multiple Workspaces? The section below is geared towards Trello Premium users; if you already have a Trello Enterprise account, check out theTrello Enterprise Getting Started Guide - System Admins.If you would like to sign up for Trello Enterprise or want more information on the Enterprise admin features, contact ushere.With your Workspace created, members invited, boards added, and collaboration in full swing, it’s time to take a moment and go over a few ways you can better administer your Workspace.Free Workspaces admin featuresOn a free Workspace, it’s easy to collaborate because all members are granted admin status by default. When everyone on the Workspace has uniform permissions, there are no blockers to team productivity. Here’s what free Workspace admins can do:Member and guest permissionsInvite and remove Workspace membersCreate Workspace invite linksConvert guests into Workspace membersBoard ControlView and join Workspace-visible and public boards (provided boardsettingsallow self-join)Workspace ControlEdit Workspace profile information, such as name and descriptionChange the Workspace visibilityUpgrade the Workspace toPremiumRequest to add a Workspace to anEnterpriseDelete the WorkspaceIf your Workspace requires more granular permissions, such as managing who is an admin or normal member, changing permissions is available as aTrello Premium feature (see the section below Go Big With Premium).For free Workspaces (those that haven't upgraded to Trello Premium) being a Workspace admin doesn't grant admin control over Workspace boards—to make changes to other users' boards in your Workspace, you'll need to be invited as a board admin manually.Workspace VisibilityFrom your Workspace page, click the “Settings” tab where you can set your Workspace visibility.Workspace visibility is about whether your Workspace will be indexed by search engines or visible to people outside of the Workspace. Visibility can be set to public or private. This does NOT mean that your private or Workspace visible boards will be suddenly visible to the public. Don’t worry!However, let’s say you plan on creating a lot of awesome public boards like a product roadmap, a user community board, or a resource board for information about your team or business. In those cases, having a publicly visible Workspace might be right for you since it will provide a dedicated place for your users, customers, and fans to go to check out your public boards.Setting board permissionsWhile we already mentioned it inChapter 2, we think it's always important to reiterate key details regarding board permissions and visibility, so here's a quick recap.If you are creating a board that is housed within a Workspace, then the default setting is Workspace visible.\nThese are the privacy options by board setting:If a board is Workspace visible it means any members of that Workspace can view, join, and edit cards.If a board is Private, only members of that specific board can view the board and join and edit cards.If a board is Public, anyone with the link to the board can view the board, but only members of the board can edit cards. Note: These boards are indexed by search engines and are publicly visible on the internet.Learn morehereUser management with Trello PremiumAs your team grows, you need to make sure that the right people have the right access to Workspace boards.

                        "description": "Timeline viewTimeline is a beautiful, tactile view of how the team’s work fits together. Build a powerful yet easy-to-use Timeline for any project you are working on. You'll catch any roadblocks before they happen, view upcoming deadlines, and stay aware of all the work your team is working on. You'll become the maestro of your project and your team will thank you for how smoothly everything is being managed.Feature focus:Lanes:Lanes are the placeholders for cards. A lane can be shared by various cards as long as they don’t share the same period of time—in which case, a new lane is created. They let you get perspective on how tasks fit together on your timeline.Today and time arrows:Same as for the calendar, \"today\" and time arrows are your ally when it comes to navigating your timeline and not getting lost too far ahead.Add start/due dates:From the card back, add a start date and due date. Once your card has a date and is in a lane, you are ready to stretch the date range. You'll be able to stretch them naturally over the timeline to set up a new date range.Unscheduled cards drawer:All cards with no dates can be easily accessed here. Just open it up, choose the card, and add a date. Voila, your card will pop on your timeline and fit immediately at the right place to make your plan move forward.Group by:Grouping lets you have a different perspective of your workload and organize your timeline by list, member, or label. Want to see a team member's workload? Group by member and immediately drag and drop cards between lanes if some tasks need to be rearranged to have a balanced workload within your team.Zoom in:Change the granularity of time by zooming in. You can now zoom by day/week/month/quarter/year so you can travel from your team’s weekly goals to your quarterly planning or your yearly roadmap.Timeline view is great for:Planning every product sprint from start to ship:Create anew labelfor each sprint to organize cards in lanes by sprint and see your project come together from start to finish.Getting a birds-eye-view on company goals and OKRs:Zoom out to quarterly and yearly views in Timeline and see everything in the pipeline that ladders up to the company goals.Organizing and executing events seamlessly:Attach slide decks, assets, and speaker information to cards to keep everything organized in one place and always on hand during the event with the Timeline view on your mobile device.Managing team workload and preventing overload:Discover which team members have time to take on more tasks or when work needs to be divided up and conquered together.Checking and adjusting your timeline on the go:The Timeline view works really well in your Trello app so you can keep track of and update dates on from anywhere.",

These commands can be set to run at specific times on daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly times of your choosing.Here’s a way you can set up every week for success with a Calendar command to do weekly routine board maintenance:Every Monday at 9:00am...Archive all of the cards in the Done listMove the cards from the Next Sprint list to the To Do listSort all of the cards in the Doing list by due date.Due date commands use a card’s due date as a trigger and can be programmed to take a series of actions as a card’s due date gets closer, the moment is due, or a set period of time after the card is due.Setting due date commands is a great way to make sure nothing important falls through the cracks by flagging incomplete cards that are overdue:The moment a card is due...Move the card to the top of the listAdd the red label to the cardPost a comment “@card What’s the status of this?”",

                        "description": "Automations for email and integrationsTake automation beyond your boards with automations that utilize email and integrations with Slack and Jira. This makes it super convenient to automatically share information and updates with external stakeholders, clients, or colleagues that are working in other apps that your team relies on.For example, consider creatingweekly reportsthat emails the status of cards on a board to team leads with scheduled commands. Or, if you are working with external stakeholders, set up a rule that automatically emails clients when feedback is needed by triggering an email to send whenever a card is dragged to the “Needs Feedback” list.Setting up email sends with automation is just like setting up any other action:When creating a rule, card button, or due date command, select “Content,” or when creating a board button or scheduled command, select “Other” from the actions menu.Fill out the email subject and body content you would like to have sent.Consider usingvariablesto populate automated emails with specific content from your cards and board.The Jira integration is great when one team is tracking work in Trello but another might be tracking theirs in Jira, because it allows you to create new Jira issues or post comments to existing tickets. With Slack, keep everyone in the loop by posting comments to Slack channels with important updates from Trello.To integrate Trello automation with Slack and Jira:From the actions menu, when creating a new automation, select the Jira or Slack tabs.Authorize the app to be used by Trello automationSelect the actions you would like automated to perform in the external app.Trello Tip:Trello automation has so much to offer—there’s no way we could fit it all into a single article.Check out our extensive automation help documentationfor even more tips and tricks for getting the most out of automation in Trello.",

It provides a place to add details about a board's purpose, goals, and so much more. It is helpful to anyone joining your board—from a client, to a new team member, to a temporary stakeholder.The ‘About This Board’ feature should have three sections:Made by:to highlight the creator(s) of a given board.Description:to share all the details regarding the board’s context, purpose, best practices, and stages.Actions:to easily highlight the voting and commenting permissions.",

But is it deserved?Dispelling remote work myths: tips & best practicesHow to embrace remote workDispelling remote work myths: tips & best practicesHow to build strong communication and collaboration with a remote teamAll the tools to make remote work coolHow to create a remote team cultureFind (and land) the perfect remote jobWhen the topic of remote work comes up, it’s not uncommon for people to become immediately skeptical. Common narratives include:“That could never work with our system.”“In theory it sounds good, but remote people can’t come to meetings and they never have all the information.”“Yeah, we tried that, but it didn’t really work and the remote people ended up getting fired.”“How do you know people aren’t slacking off?”Yikes.All of these statements are working off of either wrong assumptions or process failures. Remote work is getting a bad name when in fact there are easily identifiable behaviors and policies that are causing the problems.Effective remote work starts at the top. When company culture leaders correct non-remote friendly behaviors and put inclusive processes in place, the effects trickle down into a successful experience for everyone.MYTH #1“Remote workers are slackers”There is a perception that if you can’t physically see someone sitting at their desk doing work, then they’re not getting anything done.Any worker, regardless of location, can slack off if managers are not properly communicating expectations and deadlines. If someone understands what work they are responsible for (goals) and when it needs to be done (deadlines), and they work accordingly (with regular status updates), then they surely won’t warrant a “slacker” title, no matter where they’re located. Teams that reward results will attract and retain people that will be productive anywhere.Tip: In addition to a chat tool for quick conversation, managers should also be having weekly check-ins via video call with their direct reports to answer questions and learn of any setbacks.Never work from bed.When I started working 100% remotely at Buffer, I set the rule for myself that I would never work from bed, and here’s why:It becomes more difficult to fall asleep because working from bed weakens the mental association between your bedroom and sleep.You may start to feel like you’re always at work and lose a place to come home to.Your quality of sleep will decrease because using electronics before bed reduces the melatonin you need to fall asleep.- Hailley Griffis, Future of Work Marketer, BufferMYTH #2“It is up to the remote worker to constantly prove they are working”A lot of remote workers feel like they constantly need to be “visible” in their digital workspaces to “prove” that they are working. They feel they need to be present for every discussion in chat, or can’t let a notification go unanswered for more than a few minutes.This pressure adds unnecessary anxiety. Instead of being able to do their deep work, they are constantly worrying about how their contributions are perceived.Implicit in these beliefs is the concept that remote workers are “other” or somehow different than their other colleagues. If remote workers are feeling this pressure to be visible, then it likely stems from the idea that they’re not being valued at the same level as in-office workers.Tip: These anxieties are ameliorated when remote work is normalized company-wide. These colleagues aren’t different or lacking (they may even experience fewer distractions). Everyone should indicate “deep work” times on their calendar, or use a status update in their chat tool to indicate their availability.Remote workers are getting up and going to work every day just like everyone else, except they probably have a shorter commute!MYTH #3Remote work means company culture suffersSome people are wary of remote teams because they fear a lack of team camaraderie. It’s true that there are no silly interactions in the kitchen or casual hallway “stop and chats” on remote teams, however, with effective planning, these social moments can be baked into a remote dynamic.Tip:Seeing as up to 10,000 non-verbal cues can be exchanged in one minute of face-to-face interaction, video meeting tools are essential for building relationships with others. You can set up team-building activities over video that play into the strengths of remote work, like sharing your office view or introducing your cat to your coworker’s cat and watching the furry friendship unfold.In fact, we’ve written an entire chapter on remote work company culture tips for this guide.Read more here.MYTH #4“Remote workers are available all times of day”It’s easy to assume that because someone is always at home that they are available to answer a quick work question at any time. This is unequivocally false.One of the most espoused remote work best practices is to set strict working hours, just as one would if they worked in an office. Remote workers are encouraged to decide on (and communicate) available hours, take proper lunch breaks, and to physically turn off and exit their work space when they are engaging in their home life. Work-life separation is still very possible, even if your office is inside your house!Tip:Track workday availability on a team board where other important information is housed. If it’s unclear whether someone is currently available, you can double-check the card to know for sure!Pace yourself.Working remotely means you get a ton of quiet, heads-down time to do deep work. But deep work is exhausting! Build 5-minute breaks into your day: walk around the block, call your mom, pet your cat. Take care of yourself so you still have gas left in the tank on Friday to enjoy your personal time.- Sarah Goff-Dupont, Principal Writer, Atlassian, remote from MinnesotaHow to build strong communication and collaboration with a remote teamMore remote work articlesBlogThe 10 Biggest Misconceptions Of Remote WorkBlogA Manager's Step-By-Step Guide To Leading A Remote TeamTrello has everything you need to get things done.Become one of the millions of people to fall in love with Trello.Sign up—it's free",

It can be used for something that needs to get done like a customer support issue, a new design, a blog post,  or something project-related that you need to be reminded of.Cards can be customized to hold a wide variety of useful information by clicking on them. Drag and drop cards across lists to show progress. There’s no limit to the number of cards you can add to a board.Add cards for each task that needs to be completed by clicking “Add A Card” in the first list. Keep card titles short to make it easier to scan and see the status of each card on the board.So that everyone has a clear understanding of what needs to get done, click on cards to add more information such as:DescriptionsDue datesMembersChecklistsAttachmentsCommentsGet Specific On The Card BackAs mentioned earlier, you can click on a card to expand it and add and access more details. This is the “card back” and it is where you can get more specific with your information.It has three main sections worth getting to know:A. Card Descriptions:When your team is communicating daily, you need the ability to add and understand context. With the right information, you can preface communication and help prevent any miscommunication related to your project. For members who aren’t managing the board daily but need to check in regularly, this can be very helpful.In the description field you can add more specific information about your card such as links to websites or step by step instructions. To add details to your card click “Edit the description” at the top of the card back. You can even format your text with Markdown.B. Add:The “Add” section provides you with more tools for the back of a card.Add Members to cards to assign people to tasks, and easily see who is doing what and what still needs to get done.Add Checklists to cards that require subtasks or have multiple steps to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. You can even copy checklists from other cards on the board. For additional clarity and accountability, assign members and add due dates to checklist items with Advanced Checklists, available toStandardandPremiumsubscribers.Add a date to cards to track deadlines, and card members will receive a notification 24 hours before it’s due. From the date menu, you can pick a start date and a due date to keep track of when projects and tasks begin and end. Once the tasks are completed, dates can be marked as done.Add Attachments from both your computer and many cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, and OneDrive.Cover: Make your board extra organized and visual. By adding covers and colors to your cards you gain visual context and have the ability to provide additional callouts and details. Images that have been attached to the card can be displayed on the front as full-sized covers, and you also have the ability to change the color of a card.Pro tipSet reminders at a granular level by choosing specifically when you want to be reminded when a date is due.C. Comments and Activity:Comments can be added to cards when communicating and collaborating with team members, like giving feedback or updates. @ mention a member of your board or team in a comment and they will receive a notification in Trello. The activity feed is a timeline of all of the comments and actions on a card.Now you can see how Trello keeps everyone on the same page with all of the information in one place.

Visibility can be set to public or private. This does NOT mean that your private or Workspace visible boards will be suddenly visible to the public. Don’t worry!However, let’s say you plan on creating a lot of awesome public boards like a product roadmap, a user community board, or a resource board for information about your team or business. In those cases, having a publicly visible Workspace might be right for you since it will provide a dedicated place for your users, customers, and fans to go to check out your public boards.Setting board permissionsWhile we already mentioned it inChapter 2, we think it's always important to reiterate key details regarding board permissions and visibility, so here's a quick recap.If you are creating a board that is housed within a Workspace, then the default setting is Workspace visible.\nThese are the privacy options by board setting:If a board is Workspace visible it means any members of that Workspace can view, join, and edit cards.If a board is Private, only members of that specific board can view the board and join and edit cards.If a board is Public, anyone with the link to the board can view the board, but only members of the board can edit cards. Note: These boards are indexed by search engines and are publicly visible on the internet.Learn morehere",

Customize your board to combine all your team's priorities and build robust and unique workflows. The best part is, unlimited Power-Ups are available with every Trello plan, so you can have all the power of Trello at your fingertips. Power-Ups go from board utilities such as Card Repeater or List Limits, to connecting your boards to more than 200 powerful apps and integrations. Time to try them all!Stay accountable for recurring tasks with Card RepeaterWhether you are a manager or have a more operational job, some tasks need to be frequently repeated. Stay accountable for those recurring tasks with the Card Repeater Power-Up, which allows you to create exact copies of cards at the frequency that you set.Example— Automate Repeating Reports: Sales and financial teams that need to put together weekly, monthly, and annual sales reports can have those tasks added to their to-do list with the Google Sheets file already attached to the card.Clearly part your project with List LimitsSet some boundaries to your board to keep your teams focused on what really matters. Set a limit on your lists and Trello will highlight the list if the number of cards in it passes this limit.Example—Set up a free-flowing editorial calendar: For illustration design to not become a bottleneck on your editorial calendar, set a List Limit and make sure your editors don't drag more than a limited number of cards into the ‘Ready for Design’ list.",

Cards are the backbone of Trello: they can be tasks, meeting notes, team reports, sales leads— they can be pretty much everything!Over the years we made them evolve, become more powerful, adapt to your needs, and even provide some joy. Let's have a look at those magical features.Card coversCard covers are a delightful yet powerful way of conveying information not only with words, but with color or images.  Either as a header or as a full card cover, you can add an image or a color of your choosing to your card front. It will make your boards even more visual and help highlight specific information. We know it: you'll judge the card by its cover.With the Card Cover button, you can select if you want the cover to be above the card title or take the full height of the card, which will hide the card front. You can upload your own cover image, select it through different attachments on the card, or be creative and pick a photo directly from the Unsplash gallery. We give you even more options as you can select whether the title will be displayed in light or dark text.Card separatorBreak down your list of cards with a simple line break. Add 3 dashes (“---”) as your card title, and a card separator is born!\nYou can move the separator around between cards as your board evolves and changes.Bring some humanity to the digital officeAn office, company, or any human endeavour are first and foremost created by humans. Humans thrive when they come together to build amazing projects. To make sure Trello places the human in the center of it all, we built some tiny yet fundamental and delightful features to make sure you bring your humanity to work. Those sparks of emotions will not only delight your day but increase your collaboration by making communication lighter, nicer and simply more human.Emoji reactionsShow your emotions at work and in context! Anyone leaving a comment on a Trello card can also reply with an emoji reaction. So when amazing things happen in Trello, don’t limit your celebration to just words—you can also get... emojinal 😂To add a reaction to a comment, just click the emoji icon beneath the comment and select an emoji. Or, click an emoji that has already been added to reinforce the feels.StickersAdd Trello stickers to your cards to give them some personality. Did you just launch a new feature?

Get in on the celebration train by simply placing any one of the following emoji into the title of the list of your choice:🎉 🎊 🎇 🎆 ✨ 👖Drag a card to this list. Enjoy.Go the extra mileMark as doneWhen getting work done in Trello, make sure to share it with your team so that no one will have to interrupt your workday wondering the status of a task (and also to show how awesome you are, obviously).Here are a couple of ways you can show off what’s getting done:Create a “Done” list and move cards there when they are completed. It might make sense to create a new “Done” list of each week for standups and retrospectives.If you add due dates to cards,mark them doneby clicking the checkbox on the back of the card. The badge will go from angry red to soothing green... Ahh.Create a labelto signify “done” (party pink perhaps?) and apply the label to completed cards.Make a “Done” checkbox with theCustom Fields Power-Up.Drag and drop a celebratory sticker to a card when you want to share your accomplishments.Archive it! Out of sight, out of mind.Pro-tip:Celebrate even faster by setting up any of the above to run automatically, thanks to a no code automation rule.ShortcutsTrello has a ton of time saving keyboard shortcuts, which when added up should equal an extra coffee break a day or two.

Learn how to build your first board and start moving work forward.Build your first project in TrelloAs with any project, you need to manage a lot of information, track task statuses, and pull in the right stakeholders at every phase of the project. The objective is to move forward at a steady pace and ensure you can deliver on time and within budget—all while keeping a smile on your face.Trello can help you every step of the way. Now that we have the basics down for setting up a Trello board, it’s time to get the ball rolling on your first project.Section OverviewIn this section you will learn:Create a boardCustomize your boardStart collaboratingBuild a workflowAdd tasks and to-dosCreate a boardStructuring a project with all the members, ideas, tasks, and due dates and optimizing it for team collaboration can be overwhelming. Thankfully, you can get a fresh start with a Trello board where you can organize everything to meet your needs and be successful.From the team’s Workspace tab, click “Create new board” or click the plus button (+) in the Trello header directly to the left of your name, and select “Create Board”.Name the board to represent whatever you are working on, from organizing an event or managing a blog, to tracking sales leads or launching a new product.Your project data and information are your most valuable assets. As you work through creating a new Trello board, you will have options for adjusting your privacy settings.When you are creating a board, the default setting is ‘Workspace Visible’ which means any members of that Workspace can view, join, and edit cards.If you change your settings toPrivate, only members of that specific board can see it. Typically, you want to default to Private if you are working on a more restrictive project and do not want other team members to access it. It is great for 1:1 boards, personal to do's boards or boards shared with customers.Publicboards allow anyone with the link to the board to see it. Public boards are ranked on search engines such as Google, meaning that any information on this specific board will be accessible to anyone on the internet. This setting can be used for a public project or for product roadmap that is open to public feedback. Just like other board settings, you can granularly choose who can comment, add or remove members, and edit and join the board.For more information about public and private boards, read morehere.Customize your boardNo two workflows are alike, so why not give each board a unique look and feel? In the spirit of fun and flexibility, we let you customize your board background to reflect your team’s unique personality.You can pick one of our basic colors, upload your own personal image*, or pick a picture fromUnsplash’shuge library of photos for beautiful and unique board backgrounds. You can always change a board background at any time from the board’s menu.Start collaboratingWhether a member is in charge of a project or only checks in occasionally for project status updates, ensuring all team members are on the same page results in a better project collaboration experience.Invite members to the board so that they can be assigned to tasks and collaborate on the board.From the top of the board, click “Invite” and select a member of your team to add to your board, or invite members by their email address or name.At the bottom of the Invite menu you can get an easy-to-share invite link to your board at the bottom of the Invite menu. Drop the special link in a Slack channel or email it to external stakeholders to start collaborating. To be even fancier, you can download a QR code for people to scan to invite them to your board.Set member permissionsSet member permissions to define roles transparently. Member permissions gives you granular control to give the right access to the right person. Become familiar with the following user settings to make sure the right information can be controlled by the right people:Normal:can view and edit cards, they can also edit some board permissions depending on what settings you put together.\nGreat for workspace members actively working on a project.Admin:can view and edit cards, remove members and change all the settings of the board.\nGreat for project leaders or managers who have full control over the project.Observer*:can access content displayed on a board, they can't edit cards but you can allow them to comment, emoji react and engage to the level you define with the board.\nGreat for boards you want to inform people on such as clients, managers, third party, etcBuild a workflowLists in Trello help you organize your cards by status. They can represent different things like a collection of ideas or tasks within a larger project. However, whether it’s basic Kanban, a sales pipeline, a marketing calendar, or robust project management, what matters most is establishing a workflow for the way your team works.Click \"Add a list\" to add your first list to your board and title it to represent the stage or information that it will hold. List names can be as simple as steps like “To Do,” “Doing,” and “Done” or as detailed as needed for the work you are doing. Remember: Trello is truly customizable to your unique needs so just go ahead and name your lists anything you like!Add as many lists to your board as you need to build out a workflow.Add tasks and to-dosAs a fundamental unit of a board, cards are used to represent tasks and ideas. It can be used for something that needs to get done like a customer support issue, a new design, a blog post,  or something project-related that you need to be reminded of.Cards can be customized to hold a wide variety of useful information by clicking on them. Drag and drop cards across lists to show progress. There’s no limit to the number of cards you can add to a board.Add cards for each task that needs to be completed by clicking “Add A Card” in the first list. Keep card titles short to make it easier to scan and see the status of each card on the board.So that everyone has a clear understanding of what needs to get done, click on cards to add more information such as:DescriptionsDue datesMembersChecklistsAttachmentsCommentsGet Specific On The Card BackAs mentioned earlier, you can click on a card to expand it and add and access more details. This is the “card back” and it is where you can get more specific with your information.It has three main sections worth getting to know:A. Card Descriptions:When your team is communicating daily, you need the ability to add and understand context. With the right information, you can preface communication and help prevent any miscommunication related to your project. For members who aren’t managing the board daily but need to check in regularly, this can be very helpful.In the description field you can add more specific information about your card such as links to websites or step by step instructions. To add details to your card click “Edit the description” at the top of the card back. You can even format your text with Markdown.B. Add:The “Add” section provides you with more tools for the back of a card.Add Members to cards to assign people to tasks, and easily see who is doing what and what still needs to get done.Add Checklists to cards that require subtasks or have multiple steps to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. You can even copy checklists from other cards on the board. For additional clarity and accountability, assign members and add due dates to checklist items with Advanced Checklists, available toStandardandPremiumsubscribers.Add a date to cards to track deadlines, and card members will receive a notification 24 hours before it’s due. From the date menu, you can pick a start date and a due date to keep track of when projects and tasks begin and end. Once the tasks are completed, dates can be marked as done.Add Attachments from both your computer and many cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, and OneDrive.Cover: Make your board extra organized and visual. By adding covers and colors to your cards you gain visual context and have the ability to provide additional callouts and details. Images that have been attached to the card can be displayed on the front as full-sized covers, and you also have the ability to change the color of a card.Pro tipSet reminders at a granular level by choosing specifically when you want to be reminded when a date is due.C. Comments and Activity:Comments can be added to cards when communicating and collaborating with team members, like giving feedback or updates. @ mention a member of your board or team in a comment and they will receive a notification in Trello. The activity feed is a timeline of all of the comments and actions on a card.Now you can see how Trello keeps everyone on the same page with all of the information in one place.

Common narratives include:“That could never work with our system.”“In theory it sounds good, but remote people can’t come to meetings and they never have all the information.”“Yeah, we tried that, but it didn’t really work and the remote people ended up getting fired.”“How do you know people aren’t slacking off?”Yikes.All of these statements are working off of either wrong assumptions or process failures. Remote work is getting a bad name when in fact there are easily identifiable behaviors and policies that are causing the problems.Effective remote work starts at the top. When company culture leaders correct non-remote friendly behaviors and put inclusive processes in place, the effects trickle down into a successful experience for everyone.Read moreHow to build strong communication and collaboration with a remote teamRemote team communication requires two basic things: thoughtful consideration and some adaptations for the virtual office.As more teams go digital and turn to remote work, it’s important to remember that the kinds of nuanced communication you get in an office setting don’t necessarily translate online.Setting some ground rules for team communication goes a long way in making sure your team is productive and happy.Read moreDigital tools needed to work remotelyTools matter more in remote work because they are the foundation for communication. You cannot walk up to someone’s desk to talk to them; you need to adapt tools to become your \"virtual office.\" After all, if technology hadn’t advanced to what it is today, remote work wouldn’t even be possible.Here’s a roundup of the most important types of tools you need to consider for remote work, as well as some specific recommendations.Read moreHow to create a company culture as a remote teamOne of the biggest concerns when considering remote-friendly work is the perceived culture hit. Workplaces have relied on co-location to build corporate culture for so long that it seems bleak to think of a December without the requisite tinsel-and-punch office holiday party.The key to building great remote relationships is intention. You need to try harder to find common interests, have meaningful meetings, and truly understand each person's perspective. The result can be a lasting network of true friends that you can depend on, no matter where your travels might take you.Creating a strong remote team culture depends on two things:A clear set of \"rules to live by\" that have 100% buy-in across the company.A healthy system of meetings, events, and habits that keep people communicating.Oh, and don't forget to use a lot of 😄 and 👍Read moreFind and land the right remote job: tips & tricks for interviews & hiringIn 2018, 56% of companies around the world allowed employees to work remotely.Remote opportunities aren’t just becoming easier to source, they are being developed by companies who are purposefully building a remote-friendly work culture (and looking for the right candidates to thrive in it).Read moreDispelling remote work myths: tips & best practicesTrello has everything you need to get things done.Become one of the millions of people to fall in love with Trello.Sign up—it's freeYour Hybrid Work hubExplore curated resources on work-life balance, comms, and project managementLearn about Hybrid Work",

Learn how to build automations to tackle the tedious tasks that slow down productivity.SECTION OVERVIEWIn this section you will learn:Intro to automationGetting started with automationRule based automationCard and board buttonsCalendar and due date commandsAutomations for email and integrationsIntro to automationOftentimes, our most productive moments are blocked by the tedious, administrative tasks that need to be performed to keep things organized or move work forward. Luckily, Trello has a built-in automation system that makes it easy for anyone to automate just about any action in Trello.With automation you can create:Rulesthat instantly run a set of actions when triggered by a defined action.Buttonsthat run action on a card or across an entire board in a single click.Due date commandsthat run in relation to approaching or past due dates.Calendar commandsthat run at set calendar intervals.Trello automation’s simple native language system requires no coding, and automations can be set up in seconds. Let’s take a look at just what automation can do for you.Getting started with automationClick “Automation” in the board menu to open the command window and create and manage automations for your board. Within automation you will find:Automation tips:Automatically detect repetitive actions you take on the board and suggest them as automations that can be added to a board in a single click. This is a great way to quickly get started with automation.Rules, card buttons, board buttons, calendar, and due date:Click on any one of these to create, edit, share, enable, and remove automations on a board.Get help:With automation, the possibilities are nearly endless—which is why we’ve provided extensive documentation with tips and tricks to help you out.Connected apps:With automation, you can not only create automations within Trello, but you can also automate some actions in the other apps your team relies on like Slack and Jira.Account:See how many command runs have taken place and access quota usage.Rule based automationRules run when a set condition is met, which will then trigger a series of actions. They are an excellent way to build processes in a workflow because anyone on the board that triggers the rule will run the set actions, which means nothing important will slip through the cracks when moving work forward.Building a rule is easy:Click “Create Rule”from the rules menu.Add a trigger.This is the action that will trigger a set of predefined actions.Add actions.You can add as many actions as you need.Saveyour new rule.Some examples of useful rules:Surfacing urgent tasksTrigger:When a card is labeled “urgent.”Actions:Move the card to the top of the list, @ mention the board “Can someone take this?,” add a due date for 3 days from now.Managing incoming requestsTrigger:New card is added to “Incoming” listActions:Assign a member to the card, add a checklist with requisite subtasks, add a due date.Completing a taskTrigger:When a checklist is completedActions:Mark the due date as complete, move the card to “Done” list,  @ mention your manager “All done!” (Optional: celebratory dance around your desk.)Pro tip:Add rules directly from a list by clicking the menu icon in the top right corner of any list. We’ve also included some useful list sorting rule templates to help you get started.Card and board buttonsSometimes you want to be able to simply trigger an automation on demand, and that is where card and board buttons are powerful. At the click of a button you can activate a series of actions at the card and board level.Here’s how to add buttons to cards and boards:Click “Create button” from the card button or board button menus.Name your button and select an icon for easier visual recognition.Add actions you’d like executed whenever the button is clicked.Examples of useful buttons:Create a card button that when clicked, moves work forward to the next step in the process by:moving it to the next listadding whomever is responsible for the next stepadding a due datecreating a checklist of subtasks to keep everything on trackCreate a board button to get insight into your infinite backlog by:sorting cards by Custom Field story points, due date, votes, and more so you know what to prioritize next sprint.Pro tip:Add card buttons directly from the back of any card by clicking “Add button” from the automation section of the card. We’ve also included some useful card button templates to help you get started.Calendar and due date commandsYou also have the ability to set up automation to work on whatever schedule works for you with scheduled commands based on calendar dates or a card’s due date.Calendar commands are great for automating recurring tasks and regular board maintenance actions like moving and archiving cards, sorting lists, and adding new lists to a board. These commands can be set to run at specific times on daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly times of your choosing.Here’s a way you can set up every week for success with a Calendar command to do weekly routine board maintenance:Every Monday at 9:00am...Archive all of the cards in the Done listMove the cards from the Next Sprint list to the To Do listSort all of the cards in the Doing list by due date.Due date commands use a card’s due date as a trigger and can be programmed to take a series of actions as a card’s due date gets closer, the moment is due, or a set period of time after the card is due.Setting due date commands is a great way to make sure nothing important falls through the cracks by flagging incomplete cards that are overdue:The moment a card is due...Move the card to the top of the listAdd the red label to the cardPost a comment “@card What’s the status of this?”Automations for email and integrationsTake automation beyond your boards with automations that utilize email and integrations with Slack and Jira. This makes it super convenient to automatically share information and updates with external stakeholders, clients, or colleagues that are working in other apps that your team relies on.For example, consider creatingweekly reportsthat emails the status of cards on a board to team leads with scheduled commands. Or, if you are working with external stakeholders, set up a rule that automatically emails clients when feedback is needed by triggering an email to send whenever a card is dragged to the “Needs Feedback” list.Setting up email sends with automation is just like setting up any other action:When creating a rule, card button, or due date command, select “Content,” or when creating a board button or scheduled command, select “Other” from the actions menu.Fill out the email subject and body content you would like to have sent.Consider usingvariablesto populate automated emails with specific content from your cards and board.The Jira integration is great when one team is tracking work in Trello but another might be tracking theirs in Jira, because it allows you to create new Jira issues or post comments to existing tickets. With Slack, keep everyone in the loop by posting comments to Slack channels with important updates from Trello.To integrate Trello automation with Slack and Jira:From the actions menu, when creating a new automation, select the Jira or Slack tabs.Authorize the app to be used by Trello automationSelect the actions you would like automated to perform in the external app.Trello Tip:Trello automation has so much to offer—there’s no way we could fit it all into a single article.Check out our extensive automation help documentationfor even more tips and tricks for getting the most out of automation in Trello.Additional resourcesWebinarBring Powerful Automation To Your Boards WIth ButlerHelpAn introduction to ButlerBlogWorkflow Automation At Your Service With Trello’s ButlerNext chapterTry Premium free for 14 daysSee your work in a whole new way with Trello views.Sign up",

It's complicated… we get it!\nMost of the time emails are overwhelming, sometimes they are nonetheless relevant and full of useful information for your projects. To make sure you don't lose important information we have several ways for you to turn your emails into true action items.Email-To-BoardWhether you use your inbox for internal or external communication, you most likely rely a lot on emails to communicate. With the email-to-board feature, easily send emails to specific Trello boards or cards to start working on action items in context.Each board and each card has a unique email address you can send emails to. For boards, you’ll find it under “email-to-board settings” in the board menu. For cards, you’ll find it in the “Share” button on the card menu. Emails sent to the board’s unique email address will create a new card in the designated list with the content of your email. Emails sent to the card’s unique email address will show up as a comment on that card.From inbox zero to customized CRM, email-to-board is also the perfect match to have third parties interact with your board without even knowing it.Pro-tip:Is one of your teammates reluctant to use Trello? Ask them to email their information to your board email. Their information will be easily added to the team project.Trello for Gmail add-onWhether you are a tech nerd who loves to test new add-ons or a newbie who would like to feel more productive in just a few clicks, the Trello for Gmail add-on is the perfect fit for you.

It helps you simplify and standardize your team’s work process in an intuitive way. But don’t let its simplicity fool you! Trello is user-friendly, yet still able to handle your team’s most robust projects.This is a quick overview of the things you need to know when you are just getting started with your first project on Trello.This Guide is geared towards Trello Free, Trello Standard, and Trello Premium use cases and features. If you are an enterprise, go to theTrello Enterprise Guide.Section OverviewIn this section you will learn:What is a board?What is a list?What is a card?What is the board menu?By the way, if you're using Trello Enterprise we've got somespecial resourcesjust for you.Let’s go over the basicsA Trello board only has four key components, but unlimited possibilities:What is a board?A board (A) represents a place to keep track of information — often for large projects, teams, or workflows. Whether you are launching a new website, tracking sales, or planning your next office party, a Trello board is the place to organize  tasks, all the little details, and most importantly—collaborate with your colleagues.What is a list?Lists (B) keep cards, or specific tasks or pieces of information, organized in their various stages of progress. Lists can be used to create a workflow where cards are moved across each step in the process from start to finish, or simply act as a place to keep track of ideas and information. There’s no limit to the number of lists you can add to a board, and they can be arranged and titled however you’d like.What is a card?The smallest, but most detailed unit of a board is a card (C). Cards are used to represent tasks and ideas. A card can be something that needs to get done, like a blog post to be written, or something that needs to be remembered, like company vacation policies. Just click “Add a card…” at the bottom of any list to create a new card, and give it a name like “Hire a new marketing manager” or “Write a blog post.”Cards can be customized to hold a wide variety of useful information by clicking on them. Drag and drop cards across lists to show progress. There’s no limit to the number of cards you can add to a board. You will learn more about this in thenext chapter.Pro tipEasily add cards to a board in bulk from a list or spreadsheet by copying the list and pasting it into a new Trello card. Trello will automatically turn each line-separated item into a new card, and you can kiss those old tools goodbye.What is the board menu?On the right side of your Trello board is the menu (D)—the mission control center for your board. The menu is where you manage members' board permissions, control settings, search cards, enablePower-Ups, and createautomations. You can also see all of the activity that has taken place on a board in the menu’s activity feed. Take some time to check out everything the menu has to offer.Sounds pretty simple, right?

Just click “Add a card…” at the bottom of any list to create a new card, and give it a name like “Hire a new marketing manager” or “Write a blog post.”Cards can be customized to hold a wide variety of useful information by clicking on them.

You cannot walk up to someone’s desk to talk to them; you need to adapt tools to become your \"virtual office.\" After all, if technology hadn’t advanced to what it is today, remote work wouldn’t even be possible.Here’s a roundup of the most important types of tools you need to consider for remote work, as well as some specific recommendations.The chat tools of choice for distributed teamsSlack is the reigning powerhouse in the chat tools field, and has proven to be an engaging and fun-to-use tool for team communication, especially for remote teams.“Social” features like emoji reactions and GIPHY integrations are a positive way for remote companies to communicate more naturally.Communicating via Slack channels is also an important way to ensure no decisions are ever lost. Remote communication is asynchronous: which means keeping a record in Slack channels removes the frustrating effect of desk stop- and-chats. It also means everyone can stay informed, and even contribute to decision making (in their own time!).At Zapier, we realize that transparent communication is key to successful remote work. Nearly all of our conversations happen in public Slack channels, so anyone can chime in and read up on what’s happening across teams and departments. That’s especially helpful when working as a team across different time zones. When team members wake up, they can easily gain context and pick up where others left off instead of not knowing what went on while they were sleeping.- Wade Foster CEO, ZapierJust like real life—video call softwareWhen communication starts to get nuanced, confusing, or even heated, hop into video chat. The same way that you’d seek out a coworker in an office setting to discuss an important issue, video chat makes it much easier to mimic this interaction.Good video conferencing is one of the cornerstones of an effective remote company, and we’ve tried them all. Here are our recommendations:Zoom has proven to be the most reliable video conferencing software across all forms of internet connections, especially when handling hundreds of participants in company-wide meetings.The “gallery view” feature is a must for remote meetings with many attendees. You can also use the chat tool within meetings to establish a \"peanut gallery\" of running commentary and reactions while information is being presented.There are even fun custom backgrounds you can add as green screens that are great conversation starters for remote teams!Collaboration & status tools for the virtual officeWhen you need to see progress, at-a-glance status updates, and all relevant resources related to a project or team’s work, Trello is your virtual office. All the information updates in real-time and lives there 24/7, so team members can pick up the context, communications, and status of any request, project, meeting agenda, or other items at their convenience.By the way, Trello would not be as user-friendly of a product without the constant dogfooding it receives from the remote team that builds it.Sign Up - It's Free!Not a co-located team? Use these communication & documentation toolsInternalWhether it’s outlining policies, taking meeting notes, or writing a blog to share with your team, Confluence is a fantastic internal communication and collaboration tool. Use it for projects or as an employee handbook. It helps teams share ideas, build community, and get work done all in one open and shared workspace, regardless of timezone.ExternalWhen it comes to collaborating with people outside of the company, like freelance writers or external partners, Google Docs is the industry standard.

It's complicated… we get it!\nMost of the time emails are overwhelming, sometimes they are nonetheless relevant and full of useful information for your projects. To make sure you don't lose important information we have several ways for you to turn your emails into true action items.Email-To-BoardWhether you use your inbox for internal or external communication, you most likely rely a lot on emails to communicate. With the email-to-board feature, easily send emails to specific Trello boards or cards to start working on action items in context.Each board and each card has a unique email address you can send emails to. For boards, you’ll find it under “email-to-board settings” in the board menu. For cards, you’ll find it in the “Share” button on the card menu. Emails sent to the board’s unique email address will create a new card in the designated list with the content of your email. Emails sent to the card’s unique email address will show up as a comment on that card.From inbox zero to customized CRM, email-to-board is also the perfect match to have third parties interact with your board without even knowing it.Pro-tip:Is one of your teammates reluctant to use Trello? Ask them to email their information to your board email. Their information will be easily added to the team project.Trello for Gmail add-onWhether you are a tech nerd who loves to test new add-ons or a newbie who would like to feel more productive in just a few clicks, the Trello for Gmail add-on is the perfect fit for you.

Customize your board to combine all your team's priorities and build robust and unique workflows. The best part is, unlimited Power-Ups are available with every Trello plan, so you can have all the power of Trello at your fingertips. Power-Ups go from board utilities such as Card Repeater or List Limits, to connecting your boards to more than 200 powerful apps and integrations. Time to try them all!Stay accountable for recurring tasks with Card RepeaterWhether you are a manager or have a more operational job, some tasks need to be frequently repeated. Stay accountable for those recurring tasks with the Card Repeater Power-Up, which allows you to create exact copies of cards at the frequency that you set.Example— Automate Repeating Reports: Sales and financial teams that need to put together weekly, monthly, and annual sales reports can have those tasks added to their to-do list with the Google Sheets file already attached to the card.Clearly part your project with List LimitsSet some boundaries to your board to keep your teams focused on what really matters. Set a limit on your lists and Trello will highlight the list if the number of cards in it passes this limit.Example—Set up a free-flowing editorial calendar: For illustration design to not become a bottleneck on your editorial calendar, set a List Limit and make sure your editors don't drag more than a limited number of cards into the ‘Ready for Design’ list.Additional resourcesPower-UpsPower-Ups for Trello : get your Trello super powers nowBlog12 Power-Ups To Transform Trello Into A Powerful Task Management SoftwareWebinarPower-Up for All : turn Trello boards into living applicationsNext chapterTry Premium free for 14 daysSee your work in a whole new way with Trello views.Sign up",

Within a Workspace you'll have all the context you need to productively contribute to the collective team effort.Workspaces are a place where information can easily be found, shared, and collaborated on.When you join Trello you are automatically added to a Workspace.

When you enter an office, you’ll naturally look around to understand the environment you are stepping into. Same goes with a Trello board—and to help give your team as much context as possible, we recommend filling in the \"About This Board\" section. It provides a place to add details about a board's purpose, goals, and so much more. It is helpful to anyone joining your board—from a client, to a new team member, to a temporary stakeholder.The ‘About This Board’ feature should have three sections:Made by:to highlight the creator(s) of a given board.Description:to share all the details regarding the board’s context, purpose, best practices, and stages.Actions:to easily highlight the voting and commenting permissions.Gain cross team perspectiveGetting perspective on one's work means being able to look at it from different angles and choosing the one that is the most relevant to your job. The same goes for group work—time spent taking a step back or going deeper into specific details can help your team take the project to the next level.With our Workspace Table view you can visualize cards across boards within a Workspace, sort and filter them by various criteria. If you are a manager that is a great way to get perspectives on the workload of your team members or have an overview of a specific line of work that might happen across different teams.Learn more about Workspace viewshere.While Trello Workspaces create a robust and safe place for your team to work productively, the flexibility of Trello boards give you infinite opportunities to build the workflows your teams need to get their work done seamlessly.* Available to Premium and Enterprise customersAdditional resourcesSolutionTrello Solutions for All TeamsBlogHow To Use Trello To Manage And Inspire Your TeamWebinarBetter Boards for Team collaborationNext chapterTry Premium free for 14 daysSee your work in a whole new way with Trello views.Sign up",

Thankfully, you can get a fresh start with a Trello board where you can organize everything to meet your needs and be successful.From the team’s Workspace tab, click “Create new board” or click the plus button (+) in the Trello header directly to the left of your name, and select “Create Board”.Name the board to represent whatever you are working on, from organizing an event or managing a blog, to tracking sales leads or launching a new product.Your project data and information are your most valuable assets. As you work through creating a new Trello board, you will have options for adjusting your privacy settings.When you are creating a board, the default setting is ‘Workspace Visible’ which means any members of that Workspace can view, join, and edit cards.If you change your settings toPrivate, only members of that specific board can see it. Typically, you want to default to Private if you are working on a more restrictive project and do not want other team members to access it. It is great for 1:1 boards, personal to do's boards or boards shared with customers.Publicboards allow anyone with the link to the board to see it. Public boards are ranked on search engines such as Google, meaning that any information on this specific board will be accessible to anyone on the internet. This setting can be used for a public project or for product roadmap that is open to public feedback. Just like other board settings, you can granularly choose who can comment, add or remove members, and edit and join the board.For more information about public and private boards, read morehere.",
